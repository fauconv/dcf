Welcome to the indus_drupal8_angular2 wiki!

The goals are : 

* display datas from Drupal 8 with Angular 2
* find a way for backend developers work with frontend developers in same time (frontend should dont have to wait data from backend to work)
* avoid problem of seo with angular (not a full single page application)

TODO
* Create install script using drush or web console (move config file out of web, move content files out of sites ?) (think to trusted_host_patterns) 
* modify composer.json to require drupal and repository to this git
* add a script for crontab
* create many install mode : dev mode, prod mode with composer only, prod mode with composer and npm, prod mode with git only, prod mode with nothing. this mean create build script and install script

THE PROJECT IS JUST AT THE BEGINNING PHASE, NO STABLE VERSION YET.
