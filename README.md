## The goals are

 * Provide a Drupal 8 STANDALONE DISTRIBUTION (profiles, set of modules, theme, tools, npm/composer packages, angularJS 2 API for Drupal 8, versions management...) for developers and services companies to develop multi-sites Drupal8 / AngularJS2 ( / Ionic 2 ) (with material design) projects.
 * Provide profiles by use case:
     * internet site:
          * Angular-Drupal single page application (with ionic) (with material design)
          * Angular-Drupal multi-pages site
          * Drupal site
     * intranet:
          * Angular-Drupal single page site
          * Angular-Drupal multi-pages site
          * Drupal site
 * Find a way for backend developers to work with frontend developers in same time (frontend should do not have to wait data from backend to work).
 * In case of single page application, avoid problem of SEO with angular by using of snapshot auto generated by Drupal.
 * DCF is standalone (composer, nodejs and packages are downloaded locally in the project, no global tool needed). Only PHP CLI and a web server are needed. Environment variables are not used.
 * Stay 100% compatible Drupal, Angular, Ionic. (No core modifications, Drupal, Angular and Other libraries are downloaded from official sources and use latest version)
 * Provide a Drupal distribution with a maximum quality for redactor to manage content, images... (pre-configured roles and permissions for administrator redactor and anonymous user, pre-configured CKEditor, a set of mandatories modules: pathauto...) (Improved backoffice capability : imageMagik ...), based on [Drupal 7 custom factory](https://github.com/fauconv/ctm_drupal7)
 * DCF manage drupal multi-sites with or without apache aliases automaticaly (http://example.com/alias)



## Installation

 1. Download DCF:
     * directly on github
     * or using git (dont forget to remove the .git directory)
     * or if you already have composer you can use it : 
     `composer create-project fauconv/dcf -n --repository "{\"type\":\"vcs\", \"url\":\"https://github.com/fauconv/dcf\"}" -s dev`
 2. The document root of websites will be in `web` subdirectory. Exemple: if you place DCF in `/var/www/dcf`, the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server must be set to `/var/www/dcf/web`
 3. Deploy DCF: `scripts/project.sh deploy dev "my project"`
 4. Optionaly launch `source scripts/path.sh` to set environment path for DCF. Environment is only set for your current session, no side effect. You must launch it eachtime you open a terminal or place this command line in your .bashrc file
 5. in `config` directory create a global config fil and a local config file for your site by using the samples file and a my_site_id
 6. create a new drupal site: `scripts/project.sh site deploy my_site_id`
 7. Read [wokflow documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fauconv/dcf/master/docs/DCF_8_workflow.md) and [general documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fauconv/dcf/master/docs/DCF_8_documentation.md) for more information
