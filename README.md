# Drupal 8 Custom Factory version 0.1.0

This project is just a **SANDBOX** for the moment. **No stable version is provided yet**

 * [The goals](#the-goals-are)
 * [Installation](#installation)
 * [Compatibility](#compatibility)


## The goals are

 * Provide a Drupal 8 STANDALONE DISTRIBUTION (profiles, set of modules, theme, tools, npm/composer packages, angularJS 2 API for Drupal 8, versions management...) for developers and services companies to develop multi-sites Drupal8 / AngularJS2 ( / Ionic 2 ) (with material design) projects.
 * Provide profiles by use case:
     * internet site:
          * Angular-Drupal single page application (with ionic) (with material design)
          * Angular-Drupal multi-pages site
          * Drupal site
     * intranet:
          * Angular-Drupal single page site
          * Angular-Drupal multi-pages site
          * Drupal site
 * Find a way for backend developers to work with frontend developers in same time (frontend should do not have to wait data from backend to work).
 * In case of single page application, avoid problem of SEO with angular by using of snapshot auto generated by Drupal.
 * DCF is standalone (composer, nodejs and packages are downloaded locally in the project, no global tool needed). Only PHP CLI and a web server are needed. Environment variables are not used.
 * Stay 100% compatible Drupal, Angular, Ionic. (No core modifications, Drupal, Angular and Other libraries are downloaded from official sources and use latest version)
 * Provide a Drupal distribution with a maximum quality for redactor to manage content, images... (pre-configured roles and permissions for administrator redactor and anonymous user, pre-configured CKEditor, a set of mandatories modules: pathauto...) (Improved backoffice capability : imageMagik ...), based on [Drupal 7 custom factory](https://github.com/fauconv/ctm_drupal7)
 * DCF manage drupal multi-sites with or without apache aliases automaticaly (http://example.com/alias)



## Installation

 1. Download the DCF Manager script:
     * [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fauconv/dcf/master/scripts/project.sh)
     * Or by using wget: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fauconv/dcf/master/scripts/project.sh`
     * Or using curl:

```
curl -o project.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fauconv/dcf/master/scripts/project.sh
```
 2. Place the script in the root directory of the future project. The document root of websites will be in `web` subdirectory. Exemple: if you place DCF Manager in `/var/www/dcf`, the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web server must be set to `/var/www/dcf/web`
 3. Give execution right to DCF Manager: `chmod 700 project.sh`
 4. Download DCF with the DCF Manager: `./project.sh get`
    Alternatively you can download directly DCF from github: https://github.com/fauconv/dcf
 5. Deploy DCF: `./project.sh deploy dev "my project name" "my project description"`
 6. Optionaly launch `source scripts/path.sh` to set environment path for DCF. Environment is only set for your current session, no side effect. You must launch it eachtime you open a terminal or place this command line in your .bashrc file
 7. create a new drupal site: `scripts/project.sh site deploy dev my_site_id`
 8. Read [wokflow documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fauconv/dcf/master/docs/DCF_8_workflow.md) and [general documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fauconv/dcf/master/docs/DCF_8_documentation.md) for more information
